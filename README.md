A Machine Learning project that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using TF-IDF Vectorization and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

⭐ Project Overview

This project uses the classic SMS Spam Collection dataset and applies:

Text cleaning & preprocessing

TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)

Train/Test Split

Multinomial Naive Bayes model

Accuracy evaluation

A custom function to test your own messages

⭐ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

TF-IDF Vectorizer

Multinomial Naive Bayes

⭐ How it Works

Clean SMS text

Convert text → numeric vectors (TF-IDF)

Train classifier using Naive Bayes

Evaluate using accuracy score

Test your own SMS using:

check_sms("Congratulations! You won a lottery!")

⭐ Model Function Example
